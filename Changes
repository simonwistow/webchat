  Release 0.63

  Must have forgotten to up a version number 
  somewhere. This fixes a bug and should make it 
  easier to install from CPAN and improve
  interoperability with Inline::Webchat

  anymore thanks to a heads up from Skud.

2001-10-05   Simon Wistow <simon@thegestalt.org>

   Release ???
   
   Patched WWW::Chat to require params to passed to make 
   it package safe although it will default to searching 
   the main:: namespace. Wrote WWW::Chat::Processor to 
   perform the job of webchatpp in a more portable way
   and rewrote webchatpp.PL (which generates webchatpp)
   to take this into account. Wrote some automatic tests
   and some ones to be run manually.
